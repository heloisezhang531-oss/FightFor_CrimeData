(Definition),,,"The Hardship Index is a composite score reflecting hardship in the community (higher values indicate greater hardship). It incorporates unemployment, age dependency, education, per capita income, crowded housing, and poverty into a single score that allows comparison between geographies. It is highly correlated with other measures of economic hardship, such as labor force statistics, and with poor health outcomes. See technical notes for details.",
